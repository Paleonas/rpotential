# Quick Talking Points for Call - January 8, 2025

## Opening
- Acknowledge Mehdi's question about Reddit vs LinkedIn prioritization
- Great to reconnect after the weekend!

## Key Messages

### 1. On Reddit vs LinkedIn Choice
**Your response**: "I started with Reddit for two strategic reasons:
1. **Technical validation** - Reddit is harder to scrape, so if we nail this, LinkedIn will be straightforward
2. **Client priority** - They specifically mentioned Reddit as a big priority
3. **Data richness** - Unfiltered conversations give us deeper insights

But I'm flexible - I'm planning to look at LinkedIn and Glassdoor before our call. The key is getting ONE platform right first."

### 2. On BCG Ninja Analysis
**Present the framework**:
- "I've prepared a structured approach that covers:
  - Platform comparison matrix
  - Proposed data schema for validation
  - Implementation roadmap
  - Analysis capabilities we can deliver"

### 3. On Weekly Sync with Mehdi
**Propose**: "Yes, absolutely! I think a weekly sync would be valuable. Would Friday afternoons or right after Monday calls work better for you?"

## Data Structure Pitch
"I've designed a comprehensive data structure that captures:
- Post content and metadata
- Full comment threads with relationships
- Engagement metrics
- Quality scoring for validation

This structure is platform-agnostic, so we can easily adapt it for LinkedIn and Glassdoor."

## Next Steps Proposal
1. "Let's validate the data structure today"
2. "I'll build the Reddit scraper this week"
3. "We can review initial results in our first weekly sync"
4. "Then expand to LinkedIn based on learnings"

## Questions to Ask
- "Any specific subreddits or LinkedIn groups you want to prioritize?"
- "What's the ideal timeline for having all three platforms running?"
- "Should we focus on real-time data or historical analysis first?"

## Closing
- "The goal is to deliver a validated, production-ready solution"
- "Starting with Reddit gives us the hardest technical challenge first"
- "But I'm ready to pivot to LinkedIn if that aligns better with immediate needs"
